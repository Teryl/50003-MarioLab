## Lab 3: Unity for Toddlers
This lab focused on Character Animations, Camera movement, and interactables with in-game physics (Physics2D).

#### In this git repo, **lab3** will be the *Main Submission repository*.

### Additional features
#### Character Updates
- Added Double Jump for Mario
  - When jumping, mario can jump again while he is in mid-air. This double jump is added so Mario can access high blocks easily.
- Added the ability to kill Goomba by stomping it
  - When Mario jumps on top of Goomba, he will now kill the Goomba instead of dying

### Points System
- Added stomping Goomba
  - Mario needs to kill Goomba in order to gain points by jumping on top of the Goomba (stomping it)
  - This will give more points compared to just collecting the coins
  - Added Goomba spawner, so Mario can score more big points
- Removed jumping over Goomba to gain points

### Audio
- Added Audio Mixer into the project
- Added SFX when performing a Double jump
- Added SFX when stomping on Goomba

### Input System
- Implemented new Input System
  - Updated the Input system to use InputActions

### Observer Pattern
