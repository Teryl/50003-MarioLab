## Lab 1: Unity for Newborns
This lab focused on initial setup, getting familiar with Unity and also delved slightly into physics and scripting.

We decided to both do this lab in its entirety, but the report will only explain one of our labs. Regardless, there will be two videos.

### Additional features
- **Mithun's Version**:
    - Tilemapped Platforms and Ground, Background, etc.

    - Additional Physics and modified detections
    - Use of Unity Input Package instead of Legacy system
- **James' Version**:
